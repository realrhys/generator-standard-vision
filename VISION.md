## Mantra
Every project should have a well defined vision.

## Principles
1. Simple and easy to use tooling
2. Short and concise workflow
3. This project does not define the standard, but will follow others lead

## Goals
1. Create a generator for the standardization of VISION.md documentation
2. Work with concert with the community as it defines best practices.

## What It Does
This project aims to create a generator for the standardization of VISION.md files. In short, we believe that visions must be short, and precise while ensuring clear boundaries are set. This will enable developers of open source projects to manage requests in a more resonable manner. In short, a clear statement of the projects intent will allow you to help others understand the boundries of your projects focus, and ideally, throttle the feature requests to a maintainable level.

Additionally, providing a VISION.md document will help you provide potential contributors with a clear representation of your projects scope and limits.

## What It Does Not Do
This project is not intended to define the best practices and outlines for VISION.md creation. In its current form, the generator is a work in progress, and as such, adheres to no standard. However, as standardization cauterizes this project intends to follow them.

## Setting Expectations
I am currently working on a ton of things and so time is limited. However, as the project is trivial in its implementation I do not expect to be overly inundated with requests. As a result, I will be monitoring this repo infrequently, so please do not get frustrated if you do not hear from me right away.
